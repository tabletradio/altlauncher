NOTE: If you install this app, it does not show up in the list of apps in the launcher that comes with the unit. During the installation process, be sure to click the "Open" button to run it once. From that point on, it will run in the background. If you don't start it during the installation process, the only way to start it is with another app that launches apps (like CarWebGuru).

The Problem: Phoenix Radios Android tablet style radios do not allow for running apps on boot. They also do not allow for running apps on fastboot. 

This app solves that problem. It allows you to launch apps on either boot or fastboot. It also can launch two apps in split-screen mode. Note that you may have to go into developer options and turn on split screen.
*  Note: need to note the actual setting.
