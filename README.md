The Problem: Phoenix Radios Android tablet style radios do not allow for running apps on boot. They also do not allow for running apps on fastboot. 

This app solves that problem. It allows you to launch apps on either boot or fastboot. It also can launch two apps in split-screen mode. Note that you may have to go into developer options and turn on split screen.
*  Note: need to note the actual setting.
